I’ll give some perspective on the topics of ease and simplicity from the eyes of a newcomer and I’ll discuss a musical metaphor to look at Clojure.

I’m a 21 year old data analyst, I currently do freelance work and I’m in my final year of university studying finance. I am a self-taught programmer, my experience with Java is limited to a few online courses.

What drew me into Clojure was it being a Lisp that I can use for the web with ClojureScript but what kept me was an appreciation for the mature ecosystem and focus on simplicity.

I think Clojure can benefit from introducing easiness for newcomers, the form of which can be templates such as Luminus but for other disciplines such as data analysis and dashboards.

I intend to answer the following questions in my talk:
- What does the build system look like to a newcomer?
- What does the ecosystem look like to a newcomer?
- What meta concepts should we encourage?

I will demonstrate some open-source habits and principles of the Clojure community which could surprise a newcomer, and are worth learning.

I will offer my perspective, as a newcomer, about aspects that could possibly open Clojure for more users, and about current projects, which could be a reason for non-lispers to learn the joys of working with Lisp and Clojure.

Finally, to reason about Clojure’s usability and ease, I will follow up on Rich Hickey’s musical instrument metaphor and propose we could rather view Clojure as a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW).

I'll briefly discuss what a DAW is and how it can be a more fitting metaphor for a programming language such as Clojure and how ease can be implemented with minimal complexity through concepts similar to "Samples" in DAWs.</p></div></main></div><script type="application/javascript" src="/ui/main.604F1033C06CCA9F9A4C8E12E028DB54.js"></script></body></html>
