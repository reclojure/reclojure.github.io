                        <h1>Keynote: Simple ideas with huge impact from Clojure
                            and Rama</h1>
                        <p>
                            Clojure is full of great ideas. Some are inherited
                            from the Lisps that came before, like homoiconicity.
                            Others are new to Clojure, like its emphasis (but
                            not mandate) on immutability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The ideas with the biggest impact eliminate
                            complexity, create leverage, or both. Both
                            homoiconicity and immutability achieve these by
                            creating uniformity. Uniformity enables composition,
                            and composition creates leverage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Rama builds upon the ideas in Clojure to bring
                            uniformity and composability to backend development.
                            Ideas like data structures instead of data models
                            for indexed datastores and colocating computation
                            and storage have a huge effect on simplifying
                            backend development and enabling much more to be
                            done with much less.

                        <p>
                            Nubank runs on Clojure and Datomic, but what does that
                            really look like at scale? In this talk, I’ll share my
                            personal journey—from early interactions with the
                            Cognitect team to joining Nubank and working directly
                            with Datomic. I’ll give an inside look at how we use
                            Datomic in production, what we’ve accomplished over the
                            last year, and what it’s like being part of the Datomic
                            team today.

                        <p>
                            Electric is a new way to make rich, interactive web
                            products that simply have too much interactivity,
                            realtime streaming, and too rich network connections to
                            be able to write all the frontend/backend plumbing by
                            hand. This talk will introduce Electric v3 with an
                            emphasis on its new callback-free pure-functional
                            abstractions for user input, forms, datagrids, server
                            transactions and optimistic updates.

                        <p>
                            Large Language Models have transformed coding workflows.
                            They are particularly good at project scaffolding.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While Clojure's philosophy of composable libraries over
                            frameworks grants exceptional power and flexibility. It
                            also has a steeper learning curve for newer developers —
                            many of whom lament the absence of a Rails-like
                            framework to ease their journey.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This talk introduces a novel approach that preserves
                            Clojure's library-centric philosophy while improving
                            developer experience using LLMs.

                        <h1>Brain Data in Clojure</h1>
                        <p>
                            Human-computer interaction is a continually evolving
                            domain stemming from our roots in mechanical forms of
                            computing historically. This evolution has manifested in
                            several well-known areas such as AI, social-networking,
                            cloud computing, etc; but no field is quite as
                            mysterious, misunderstood, or inaccessible as
                            Brain-Computer Interfacing. BCI research and development
                            can seem like a daunting or even impossible field to
                            break into or contribute meaningfully to.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This talk chronicles my interdisciplinary journey to
                            processing brain data with Clojure, and exploring the
                            unique position programmers occupy within the broader
                            BCI development ecosystem. It aims to introduce the
                            audience to the foundational areas of BCI research and
                            development, while sharing my steps taken to parse and
                            visualize real world brain data to corroborate
                            authoritative BCI studies. I'll demonstrate practical
                            techniques for parsing and visualizing neural signals
                            using Clojure, making this complex domain accessible
                            to beginners while showing veterans new application
                            domains.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Importantly, this presentation confronts the
                            controversial nature of BCI technology, offering a
                            balanced yet critical examination of both its
                            revolutionary potential and serious ethical concerns.
                            I intend to communicate a nuanced perspective to open
                            peoples minds and provide a foundation for further
                            inquiry into the subject. Through accessible examples,
                            I will highlight the importance of collaboration across
                            multidisciplinary teams—programmers, engineers,
                            neuroscientists, medical professionals, and other
                            stakeholders—demonstrating that no single person can
                            tackle the complexities of BCIs alone. Attendees will
                            not only discover specific pathways to contribute, but
                            will also be encouraged to engage critically with the
                            ethical dimensions of BCI technology. Many people have
                            been unexposed to these technologies, so I aim to equip
                            listeners with the necessary lexicon and framework for
                            engaging in meaningful discussions.  The session
                            concludes with my personal goal and roadmap for a
                            Clojure wrapper around the OpenBCI API and a
                            thought-provoking discussion on responsible innovation
                            in neurotechnology.

                        <h1>Recognizing regular patterns in mixed-type sequences
                            using Symbolic Finite Automata</h1>
                        <p>
                            Run-time type-based reflection is a powerful tool which
                            is used to solve certain problems which are out of reach
                            to purely statically typed programming languages. The
                            JVM-based implementation Clojure allows a running
                            program to make certain type-based decisions which
                            cannot be made at compile time. Notably, type predicates
                            and dynamic method dispatch allow the running Clojure
                            program to make run-time decisions based on
                            characteristics of input data, the type of which cannot
                            be known at compile time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this expose, we present yet another kind of run-time
                            based type decision which allows us to arbitrate among
                            various regular patterns in otherwise untyped data. We
                            call these patterns RTEs (regular type expressions).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Clojure programs often manipulate sequences of mixed
                            typed elements. We would additionally like to specify
                            sequences of heterogeneous but regular types.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We assume the audience to already be familiar with
                            string-based regular expressions (REs). REs are used to
                            distinguish strings which follow a regular pattern such
                            as <code>$a(a|b)^*b$</code>, the set of strings
                            beginning with the character <em>a</em>, ending with
                            <em>b</em>, and with zero or more <em>a</em> or
                            <em>b</em> (or both) characters falling in between. We
                            generalize this familiar concept to define expressions
                            which specify a sequence beginning with an integer,
                            ending with a string, and with zero or more integers or
                            strings (or both) falling in between.

                            The implementation of Regular Type Expressions (RTEs) in
                            Clojure involved several challenges.

                            There are many theoretical questions which investigate
                            the limitations of the generalization from classical
                            character based regular expressions to regular type
                            expressions. Some of these concerns include habitation
                            and vacuity checks (given an RTE, can we determine
                            whether all or no sequence will match). Given two
                            types designators determine whether one is a subtype of
                            the other, and whether either is empty. Subtype
                            determination is important for guaranteeing that finite
                            automata be deterministic. Unfortunately, the subtype
                            relation cannot always be determined (for several
                            interesting theoretical reasons). We present a clever
                            procedure for DFA construction which is guaranteed to
                            be deterministic, even when the subtype relation cannot
                            be determined.

                        <h1>UI, Pure and Simple</h1>
                        <p>
                            React introduced the idea that the UI is a function of
                            application state, and it changed the way we think about
                            building UIs. Unfortunately, it also allowed mutable
                            state everywhere.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What if UI rendering was truly functional — stateless,
                            deterministic, and built entirely on data? Enter
                            Replicant: a Clojure rendering library with no
                            dependencies and no state management, just immutable
                            data and pure functions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this talk, we’ll use Replicant to explore how
                            Clojure’s strengths can refine UI development once
                            again. Let's build modular UIs that decouple rendering
                            from state management, are fully testable, and
                            dramatically simpler than the current state of the art.

                        <h1>Writing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers in Clojure</h1>
                        <p>
                            This talk showcases mcp-cljc-sdk, a Clojure SDK I've
                            written for building MCP servers. Model Context Protocol
                            (MCP) is an emerging standard that allows AI agents to
                            interact with external systems through specialized
                            servers. I'll demonstrate how MCP creates powerful,
                            composable workflows that gradually automate complex
                            tasks using real-world examples of MCP servers I have
                            written.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We'll explore why Clojure is particularly well-suited
                            for implementing MCP servers, comparing it with other
                            approaches and highlighting Clojure's strengths through
                            side-by-side code comparisons.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By the end of this talk, you'll understand how to create
                            your own MCP servers, contribute to the growing
                            ecosystem, and leverage these tools to build powerful
                            AI-enhanced applications that integrate with your
                            existing workflows.

                        <h1>Wolframite: Bringing computational intelligence to Clojure</h1>
                        <p>
                            First and foremost, we motivate the Clojure-Wolfram
                            bridge and provide a comprehensive demonstration of
                            how one might use the new library in practice:
                            whether you're an everyday programmer, who just
                            wants to edit a video, or a seasoned scientist, who
                            wants to test quantum physics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Wolframite aims not only to empower programmers but
                            also a large section of the numerical scientific
                            community who rely on tools like
                            Wolfram/Mathematica. Inevitably, tools like Wolfram
                            still need to integrate with the wider world.
                            Wolframite's Clojure provides them with a well
                            designed, more comfortable general language and
                            allows the user to leverage powerful Scicloj
                            libraries for data processing, computation and
                            visualization.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In short, we want to summarize modern scientific
                            Clojure and introduce you to Wolframite 1.0, a tool
                            that combines the best of your favourite general
                            purpose programming language with an unparalleled
                            computational kernel. Wolframite and Scicloj are now
                            ready for adoption and discussion: leaving plenty of
                            room for questions since, as we all know, iron
                            sharpens iron.
